GIS Data-driven analysis of hourly resoluted load profiles of residential buildings

The code is designed to facilitate the development of standardized electricity load profiles for Urban Energy Units (UEUs) in Oldenburg by integrating data from resLoadSIM simulations. It enables users to download and preprocess essential datasets, including UEU electricity load profiles and corresponding time periods. With a robust set of functionalities, the code can normalize electricity consumption data, classify UEUs into different groups, and arrange the data into user-friendly formats with secure indexing. It supports flexible resampling of energy data (daily, weekly, and monthly) and provides visual analysis tools for examining seasonal variations, daily profiles, and yearly demand patterns. Additionally, the code offers descriptive statistics, correlation matrices, and data filtering options, all of which contribute to creating comprehensive and reliable load profiles that can inform urban energy planning and decision-making.
